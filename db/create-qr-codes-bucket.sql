-- This SQL file is for documentation purposes only
-- The actual bucket creation is handled in the app/create/page.tsx file

-- In Supabase, storage buckets are created through the API, not SQL
-- The equivalent operation in the code is:
-- supabase.storage.createBucket('qr-codes', { public: true })
